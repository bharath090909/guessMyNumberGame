# guessMyNumberGame

A project from The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 that showcases my working knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript.<br>

Guess My Number is a simple game in which JavaScript tells whether you guess is too low or too high as you guess the number.

- Applied the knowledge of DOM manipulation and DOM events.
- Improved code readability and structure.
